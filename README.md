# ZigDbg
Windows debugger written in Zig

ZigDbg is a debugger project written in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) for Windows.  
It follows the blog series [Writing a Debugger From Scratch](https://www.timdbg.com/posts/writing-a-debugger-from-scratch-part-1/) by [Tim Misiak](https://github.com/timmisiak).  
The goal is to follow the tutorial in Zig, experiment, and learn.

While searching for a debugger for zig application, I came across WinDbg and eventually found Timâ€™s excellent series. The articles were so interesting that I decided to follow along using zig.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) (version 0.14.0 or later)
- [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows) (64-bit only)

### Building and running
To build and run an executable with the debugger, use the following command

```bash
zig build run -- hello_world.exe

# Console prompt appears on debug events:
[1234] 0x00007ff6a2b41000
> help                    # Show available commands
> r                       # Display all registers
> k                       # Show stack trace
> t                       # Single step execution
> g                       # Continue execution
> q                       # Quit debugger
> db 0x00007ff6a2b41000   # Dump memory at address
> bp 0x00007ff8d14ea65    # Set breakpoint
> ? 0x1000 + 0x200        # Evaluate arithmetic expression
```

### Testing

To run the project tests

```bash
zig build test
```
