# ZigDbg
Windows debugger written in Zig

ZigDbg is a debugger project written in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) for Windows.  
It follows the blog series [Writing a Debugger From Scratch](https://www.timdbg.com/posts/writing-a-debugger-from-scratch-part-1/) by [Tim Misiak](https://github.com/timmisiak).

While searching for a Zig-based debugger, I came across WinDbg and eventually found Timâ€™s excellent series. The articles were so interesting that I decided to follow along using zig.
